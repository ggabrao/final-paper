    After the first experience as a developer in one of the best IT companies, I decided to specialize in the frontend.
    I did a deep study on the Angular Framework, expanding my skills to build any scale of web
    apps and websites.
    Now, <strong>I'm
      looking for
      new opportunities</strong> to keep learning and continue my career as an <strong >Angular
      Developer</strong>.
